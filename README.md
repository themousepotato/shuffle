A basic block game made with python.

### Technologies:
- `Python 3.6`
- `wxpython` [tutorial](https://wxpython.org/pages/overview/index.html)

### How it works?
The player needs to shuffle the dark blocks and make them disappear. 
It's a fun project to give a skeleton of building simple games with python using wxpython and encourage you contributing to gnome games project.
